# 🇰🇪 Kenyan Supply Chain dApp

A decentralized blockchain application for tracking farm produce (such as coffee or tea) from Kenyan farmers to consumers or export markets. It ensures transparency, prevents fraud, and guarantees fair payments.

This dApp is built using **Solidity**, **React**, **Hardhat**, and **Ethers.js**, and is ideal for learning and showcasing blockchain-powered solutions for real-world problems in Kenya.
